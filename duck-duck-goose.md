Your friend is attempting to implement the [duck, duck, goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck,_duck,_goose) game.
They have split their code into multiple files and they are using the [lodash](https://lodash.com/) library in their code.
However, their code is not working because they are not using CommonJS modules and have not installed lodash with npm.
Help your friend get their code working, so they can run `node app.js` successfully.

## Setup
While in your `challenges` folder, run the following:

```sh
$ et get duck-duck-goose
$ cd duck-duck-goose
```

## Tips
* Your friend's implementation is correct so you do not have to modify any existing code. All you need to do is add additional code to get the program to run.
