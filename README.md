# duck_duck_goose_npm


Your friend is attempting to implement the duck, duck, goose game. They have split their code into multiple files and 
they are using the lodash library in their code. However, their code is not working because they are not using 
CommonJS modules and have not installed lodash with npm. Help your friend get their code working, so they can 
run node app.js successfully.

* installed npm lodash
* installed yarn 
- added "var _ = require('lodash');" to both .js files
- added "var duckduckGoose = require('./duckDuckGoose');" to app.js
